<h2 id="new-website--blog">New Website &amp; Blog</h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve set up this temporary website, that will serve as a place for me to write these update blogs.
As you can see itâ€™s still very barebones, but i will slowly start giving this site a proper look.</p>

<p>I will eventually move this away from Github Pages, but for now this will be fine.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been thinking about how SCP NPCs will work in terms of research, and iâ€™ve come to the conclusion that it is not worth the effort to make this work, nor do i think itâ€™s feasible.</p>

<p>So instead SCPs will be controlled by Game Masters, which will cut down Development time of this gamemode by a lot.</p>

<p>This will also make the roleplay interaction between players and SCPs a lot better.</p>
